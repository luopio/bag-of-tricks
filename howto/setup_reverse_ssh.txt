Reverse SSH
===========

Reverse SSH forms a tunnel between the device and a public server.
The beauty is that the tunnel is formed from the device, thus
making it possible to get around NAT, firewalls and other nasties.

Here's the command to be run on the device:
  $Â ssh -nNT -R 2201:localhost:22 lauri@dev.citat.fi

This forms a tunnel from dev.citat.fi port 2201 to localhost port 22.

Now logging to dev.citat.fi as lauri and issuing
  $ ssh -p 2201 pi@localhost
Will connect you to the device itself.

It's best to use another user account for the tunnel (not lauri). So
that you can get rid of it quickly if needed.

It's also good to keep a list of what tunnels you have in the ssh config
of that user. So in ~/.ssh/config have an entry per tunnel:

host my_pi
    User pi
    Hostname localhost
    Port 2201

Then you can ssh to the public server and run 
  $ ssh my_pi
to connect.
