If you want to automatically load a browser full screen in kiosk mode every time you turn on the rpi you can add one of these two lines to the file /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

@chromium --kiosk --incognito www.google.it
@midori -i 120 -e Fullscreen -a www.google.it -p

The first is for chromium and the latter is for midori, the rpi default lightweight browser.

Hint : Since we will use the rpi as a kiosk we want to prevent the screen from going black and disable the screensaver. Edit the autostart file:

sudo pico /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

find the following line and comment it using a # (it should be located at the bottom)

#@xscreensaver -no-splash

and append the following lines

@xset s off 
@xset -dpms 
@xset s noblank 

Save, reboot.
